# e20-project

This project is designed to simulate the e20 processor, an imaginary processor developed by former NYU Professor Jeffery Epstein that acts as simplified version of x86. It uses labels to simplify algorithm, like a function call. Uses transfer values between registers and memory. It is important to break each 16-but nimber down into a 3 bit op to determine which instruction (or instructions since 6 of them use same opcode for some readon) is being used and determine the format since e20 is unlike e15's consistent 4-2-2-4, as e 20 can use 3-13, 3-3-3-3-4, 3-3-3-7, and others. From there, I made a extract bit function to get the specific values required. Another function made was a sign extender since some functions like addi and lw can take negative immediates. Most of the variables I made use the uint16_t variable type. a switch statement is used to cycle through each opcode to determnine instructions.
